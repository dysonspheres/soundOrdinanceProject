Downloaded fresh CSV table from the Sound Permits website
Removed unneeded columns and kept: SUB_TYPE, FOLDER_DESCRIPTION, APPLICANT_ORGANIZATION
Removed confusing naming for APPLICANT_ORGANIZATION like websites and duplicate names
Turn the APPLICANT_ORGANIZATION column into a text file
Used Gemini 2.5 to label the data itself by using the integrated Google search
Gave the prompt such as "Given the data, label the data with company generic type for "COMPANY_TYPES" and create a text file for the output
Put the new data from the text file, match the generic type labels to the APPLICANT_ORGANIZATION names in alphabetical order, create new column COMPANY_TYPES and input the generic types
